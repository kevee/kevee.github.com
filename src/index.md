<p class="hero">Let's build a web for everyone.</p>

I am passionate about usability and accessibility. I believe we can and should have a web that works for everyone. As a developer at a small state university, I saw first-hand the impact that clear communication and thoughtful design can have on people's lives.

## What I've been up to

- Working as the Elections Product Engineer at [US Digital Response](https://www.usdigitalresponse.org/).
- Building a [recreation guide to the Salinas River](https://salinasriver.org).
- Wrapping my head around moon phases for [Neaps](https://neaps.js.org/), a tidal height predictor for Javascript.
- Trying to maintain [listing of all public agencies and services](https://mocoloco.org) in Monterey County, California.
- [Helping the Gatsby team](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/commits?author=kevee) add and reorganize documentation.
