I've been thinkin' lately that I need to share more with the community, but I'll only do that if I have the least amount of friction as possible between me and writing. Since I always have "an awesome text editor":http://www.sublimetext.com/ open, and GitHub has been my constant companion these many years, I figured on using "Jekyll":https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll, and have been impressed so far.

I would suggest replacing our Drupal-based "Charlotte" CMS at Cal State Monterey Bay with Jekyll, but I think our users would revolt.
