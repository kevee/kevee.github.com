I really love <a href="http://drupal.org/project/workbench">the workbench suite of modules</a> for <a href="http://drupal.org">Drupal</a>, but in a recent project we just really needed to put a note on a moderation action so others would know why their excellent piece of content was rejected or moved to the "Needs more unicorns" state.

<img src="/img/wtfworkflownotes.png" alt="the workbench moderatio notes form" class="right"/>We're using this in a new project for a Drupal-based course catalog install profile. Part of the project was to include a course consent process, where faculty propose new courses, or changes to existing courses. That seemed like a perfect kind of workflow for Workbench to tackle, but faculty needed feedback, not just a change in state. So that's how *<a href="http://drupal.org/project/workbench_moderation_notes">Workbench Moderation Notes</a>* was born.
