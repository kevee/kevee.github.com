    If <strong>California</strong> were a person, the Sacramento River delta would be its navel, and I want to rest my head on it and hear the state breathe. The <strong>delta</strong> is so central geographically and biologically to the state that it's a shame so few do little more than glance at it on the drive between the Bay Area and Sacramento. <a href="http://legal-planet.org/2012/02/27/the-delta-101-of-levees-canals-whiskey/"><strong>Four out of five</strong> Californians do not know the delta even exists</a>.

    The delta is a story of water reclamation and management written into the very land itself. Nature's cursive hand is starkly contrasted by the red, straight lines of our short-sighted editorship.
