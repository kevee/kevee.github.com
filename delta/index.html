    If <strong>California</strong> were a person, the Sacramento River delta would be its navel, and I want to rest my head on it and hear the state breathe. The <strong>delta</strong> is so central geographically and biologically to the state that it's a shame so few do little more than glance at it on the drive between the Bay Area and Sacramento. <a href="http://legal-planet.org/2012/02/27/the-delta-101-of-levees-canals-whiskey/"><strong>Four out of five</strong> Californians do not know the delta even exists</a>.

  <p class="lead">
    The delta is a story of water reclamation and management written into the very land itself. Nature's cursive hand is starkly contrasted by the red, straight lines of our short-sighted editorship.

  <p class="lead">Each day is roughly 8 hours and between 70 to 90 miles, but the delta is flat, and much of the time you will be riding below sea level.</p>

    <p id="day2" class="route-directions"><strong>Acampo, Galt, Lodi, Stockton</strong> Heading west, through farms, and farms, and over levees, and through farms again. This day includes the <strong>Towns of the Delta</strong>, both large and small. We camp at the Sacramento River delta KOA.</p>
    <p id="day3" class="route-directions"><strong>Return to Sacramento, Learning</strong> A shorter day of biking so we can ensure we are on time for a return train ride. Sacramento also has the <a href="http://www.csrmf.org/">California State Railroad Museum</a>, a paddle boat, and other opportunities to learn more about the history of the delta.</p>
