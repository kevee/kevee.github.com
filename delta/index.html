    If <strong>California</strong> were a person, the Sacramento River delta would be its navel, and I want to rest my head on it and hear the state breathe. The <strong>delta</strong> is so central geographically and biologically to the state that it's a shame so few do little more than glance at it on the drive between the Bay Area and Sacramento. <a href="http://legal-planet.org/2012/02/27/the-delta-101-of-levees-canals-whiskey/"><strong>Four out of five</strong> Californians do not know the delta even exists</a>.

  <p class="lead">
    The delta is a story of water reclamation and management written into the very land itself. Nature's cursive hand is starkly contrasted by the red, straight lines of our short-sighted editorship.

  <p class="lead">Each day is divided into regions, and each day shall inform the next. Good maps shall be provided, campsites picked out, but otherwise the destination will be determined on the ground. We begin and end in Sacramento, a city that would not exist were it not for huge reclamation projects.</p>
